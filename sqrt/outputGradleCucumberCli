nguyens-mbp-2:sqrt amie$ gradle cucumberCli

> Task :cucumberCli

Scenario: Compute a value when both operands are positive # src/test/resources/features/sqrt.feature:6
  Given I have an integer "3"                             # ser515.unittest.stepdefs.StepDefsSqrt1.i_have_an_integer(java.lang.String)
  When I compute the square root                          # ser515.unittest.stepdefs.StepDefsSqrt1.i_compute_the_square_root()
  Then I should return a positive number                  # ser515.unittest.stepdefs.StepDefsSqrt1.i_should_return_a_positive_number()
